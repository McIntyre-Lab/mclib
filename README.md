# McIntyre Library
This is a set of simple classes to handle various types of genomic/transcriptomic data. Some of these classes are simple wrappers for other python modules such as `gffutils`. In order to use these classes various python modules will need to be installed. Check the import statements at the top of the script to determine dependencies.
